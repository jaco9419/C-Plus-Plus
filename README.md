High five! We just got your first program to run.

C++, like most programming languages, runs line by line, from top to bottom. Here is the structure of a C++ program:

Program Structure

In between the curly braces is what we are going to focus on for now.

<code>std::cout << "Hello World!\n";</code>

-<code>std::cout</code> is the “character output stream”. It is pronounced “see-out”.

-<code><<</code> is an operator that comes right after it.

-<code>"Hello World!\n"</code> is what’s being outputted here. You need double quotes around text. The \n is a special character that indicates a new line.

-<code>;</code> is a punctuation that tells the computer that you are at the end of a statement. It is similar to a period in a sentence.
